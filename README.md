# ask-me-anything

I am a back-end developer that does a lot of serverless things in AWS. You can
find out more about me here or on https://ndav.my.id/.

Got a question for me? Throw it into a
[discussion topic](https://github.com/nandasafiqalfiansyah/ask-me-anything/discussions)
and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!

Interested in seeing a code example from me? Add an
[issue](https://github.com/nandasafiqalfiansyah/ask-me-anything/issues) or
upvote one to request one!

## Question Ideas

- Ask me about a
  [Serverless Framework plugin I maintain](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aneverendingqs+topic%3Aserverless-plugin&type=repositories)
  or about plugins in general
- I like poking around with
  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aneverendingqs+topic%3Agithub-actions&type=repositories)
  and have a set of personal
  [workflow templates](https://github.com/nandasafiqalfiansyah/.github/tree/master/workflow-templates)
  I maintain
